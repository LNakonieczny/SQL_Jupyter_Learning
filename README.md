# SQL_Jupyter_Learning
 SQL learning project with JupyterLab and PostgreSQL
 
 This project is a little bit different form others my projects. It does not have an overall goal. It is also not a complete list of SQL statements with explanations. It is rather my personal SQL cheat sheet that will be expanded slowly over time. The idea is that if you know how to use, for example AVG(), then you know how to use any other SQL build in function or you can consult manual to figure it out. The same goes for JOINS, SUBQUERIES, VIEWS and so on. 
Content covered so far:
-	SELECT with WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ordering and aggregate functions,
-	SELECT with subqueries,
-	using INNER JOIN,
-	creating VIEW,
-	listing tables and views in database,
-	listing columns in table
